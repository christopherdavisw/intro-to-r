    "text": "Introduction to R\nWelcome to the Introduction to R class!\nNote that this site is an abridged version of the full 6 course class taught at a government agency. It has been modified for public display.\nThe repository is laid out as follows:\n\n/exercises/: the R script (.R) and Quarto (.qmd) exercises that we will be working with throughout the course\n/lesson_code/: the Quarto (.qmd) documents that are used to generate the html documents\n/_site/: the html documents of the tutorials. Open up the index.html file to view the website and corresponding materials.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nNo prior R experience is assumed to take this course. Before attending, please remember to ensure that R and R Studio have been downloaded.\nConsider changing some options in RStudio before the class. Under the Tools -&gt; Global Options menu items, you can customize multiple options to your preferences.\nI recommend to:\n\nIn General\nUncheck Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup\n\nAssign Never to Save workspace to .Rdata on exit\n\nIn Appearance\n\nPlay around with the Editor theme and decide on what you like\n\nIn R Markdown\n\nShow output preview in View Pane\nUncheck Show output inline for RMarkdown documents\n\n\n\n\nWhat is R?\nR is a free, open source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is known for robust visualization capabilities and a growing library of statistical and analytic methods.\nR has an exensive user base that benefit from the libraries that others have created through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). CRAN is a network of FTP and web servers that store versions of code and documentation for R.\nR is maintained by the R Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the continued development of R for satistical and computational research.\n\n\nWhat is RStudio?\nRStudio is a free integrated development entironment (IDE) for R, created by the private organization Posit (formally RStudio). An IDE is a graphical user interface that consolidates different features helpful for writing code into one application. Other examples of IDEs include SAS Enterprise Guide, VSCode, Jupyter, or Spyder.\nWhich IDE you might choose might depend on the programming language and personal preference. However, I recommend using RStudio forR - it has the most built out features for programming in R.\n\n\nWhy R?\n\nOpen Source: R is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified by anyone.\nPopular: R is one of the most popular statistical tools for data analysis. Given its growing popularity over paid softwares like SAS or Stata, future employees will likely know R or have some experience with it.\nExcellent visualization tools: R excels at data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and reproduciability, but it is probably best known for its graphics. R visualizations are the gold standard for reproducible data visualizations.\nFlexibility: Given its open source nature, R makes it easy to build off of work that others have already done. Over the past three decades, users have been contributing to the R ecosystem, which has allowed for the expansion of libraries and functions to do nearly any kind of data analysis task. If you have a data analysis need, it is likely that someone else has had a similar need and written code already to complete it.\nReproducible: Like most programming languages, R is fully reproducible and encourages workflows to be entirely reproducible. This means that you are able to run through the entire workflow, start to finish, and achieve the same results.\n\n\n\nOther Resources\n\nR for Data Science by Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This books is the gold standard for R programming. Co-written by the creator of tidyverse and ggplot2, this free book goes over the core concept of tidy data and how to work with tidy data in R.\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham. This book provides a more theoretical and comprehensive understanding of the decisions underlying the construction of ggplot2.\nText Mining with R: A Tidy Approach by Julia Silge and David Robinson. This book provides a comprehensive overview of text mining in R.\nGeocomputation with R by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and James Muenchow. This book provides tutorials for how to do various spatial operations in R, including analyzing and modeling geographic data, mapping (both static and interactive), and statistical operations.\nHands-On Machine Learning with R by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell. This book provides an overview of machine learning in R.\nCheat Sheets by Posit (formally RStudio). These cheat sheets are a great resource to provide an overview of relevant functions in many commonly-used packages.\nHarvardX: Data Science: Visualization. This is an online course that goes over basic data visualization principles and how to apply them using ggplot2."

In fact, we generlly want to separate out data frames at different levels of observation (such as semester) to different data frames, unless we have a specific use case for using them."

    "text": "Joining Data With Keys\nIt is a much more common use case where we want to join data with keys. That is, we want elements of one dataset to be matched to the same elements across another dataset.\nFor this, we can use joins.\nHere are four functions for doing joins in the tidyr package (loaded in tidyverse).\n\n \nEach kind of join tries to join two datasets together by row. The venn diagram above refers to what will happen to observations where keys are shared between the two data frames, what will happen when only x has a specific kehy, and what will happen when only y has a specific key.\nLet’s start with an inner_join().\nLet’s say we have the following data frames.\n\n\ndf1\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  geoid county_name   \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 01001 Autauga County\n2 01003 Baldwin County\n3 01005 Barbour County\n\ndf2\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  fips  population\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 01005    1609492\n2 01003      29629\n3 01057     203921\n\n\n\nNote that there seems to be a key that is shared across the two data frames, although the names do not match. We can still do the join based on that key with the following syntax.\n\n\n# join data such that only rows with values in key from both sides of join are retained\ninner_join(df1, df2, join_by(geoid == fips))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  geoid county_name    population\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 01003 Baldwin County      29629\n2 01005 Barbour County    1609492\n\n\n\nWe see here that the result is only two rows, because only two rows had shared keys across both datasets (01003 and 01005).\nHere’s what the othr join result in.\n\n\n# join data such that only rows with values in key from left side of join are retained\nleft_join(df1, df2, join_by(geoid == fips))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  geoid county_name    population\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 01001 Autauga County         NA\n2 01003 Baldwin County      29629\n3 01005 Barbour County    1609492\n\n\n\n# join data such that only rows with values in key from right side of join are retained\nright_join(df1, df2, join_by(geoid == fips))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  geoid county_name    population\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 01003 Baldwin County      29629\n2 01005 Barbour County    1609492\n3 01057 &lt;NA&gt;               203921\n\n\n\n# join data such that all rows are maintained from bothdata frames, regardless of key matches\nfull_join(df1, df2, join_by(geoid == fips))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  geoid county_name    population\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 01001 Autauga County         NA\n2 01003 Baldwin County      29629\n3 01005 Barbour County    1609492\n4 01057 &lt;NA&gt;               203921\n\n\n\nIf you know SQL, here are the analogs to SQL joins, as tidyr’s join syntax was inspired by SQL.\n\n\n\nWe also can join across multiple variables using similar syntax. \n\ndf1\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  state county county_name   \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 01    001    Autauga County\n2 01    003    Baldiwn County\n3 01    005    Barbour County\n\ndf2\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  state_code fips  population\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 01         005      1609492\n2 01         003        29629\n3 01         057       203921\n\n# do inner join with two columns\ninner_join(df1, df2, join_by(state == state_code, \n                             county == fips))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  state county county_name    population\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 01    003    Baldiwn County      29629\n2 01    005    Barbour County    1609492\n\n\n\n\nUsing the tidylog package\nI have not yet mentioned this package, and yet it is one of my favorite packages in R. The tidylog package prints to the console some helpful information whenever we do certain tidyverse functions. It is especially helpful with joins because we can see how many observations were joined and not joined on each side.\nWe load tidylog after we load tidyverse to use it correctly.\n\n\nlibrary(tidylog)\n\n\n# do inner join with two columns\ninner_join(df1, df2, join_by(state == state_code, \n                             county == fips))\n\ninner_join: added one column (population)\n            &gt; rows only in df1 (1)\n            &gt; rows only in df2 (1)\n            &gt; matched rows      2\n            &gt;                  ===\n            &gt; rows total        2\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  state county county_name    population\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 01    003    Baldiwn County      29629\n2 01    005    Barbour County    1609492\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe join_by() function is relatively new so the latest version of tidylog on CRAN may not have updated yet to incorporate it. To use the join_by() function with tidylog, first install the remotes package, then type remotes::install_github(\"elbersb/tidylog\") into the console."

Others will be able to quickly reproduce your work.\nI recommend to always use R projects whenever working in R. Using relative file paths (relative to the project directory) such as data/raw_data.csv instead of absolute filepaths like C:/Users/davischr/proj/intro-to-r/data/raw_data.csv can help share code ina more collaborative way - others don’t have to change your code to run it.

    "text": "Bar Charts\nThe bar chart is one of the most common data visualizations, which makes it more intuitive for readers as they are able to quickly understand the plot and what it means. There are two ways to create a bar chart in ggplot2.\n\ngeom_bar()\ngeom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group of the x-axis. In other words, geom_bar() will tabulate frequencies for you based on a categorical variable, without needing to do so yourself, and will visualize those frequencies in a bar chart.\n\n\nggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(color)) + \n  geom_bar(fill = \"cornflowerblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_col()\ngeom_col(), on the other hand, create the bars based on values within the data for both x and y. To create the above chart with geom_col(), we could use the count() function first to tabulate the data by color from the diamonds data frame. color is the name of a variable in the diamonds data frame that identifies how clear a diamond is in rating.\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt;\n  count(color, name = \"count\") |&gt; # name = just changes the name of the output from n to the value in the quotation marks  \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, \n                       y = count)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"cornflowerblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\nI often prefer to use geom_col() because I like to visually see my data when I’m using it. Plus, when using other variables to modify the graph, it is helpful to have a dataset that is at the observation-level that we are visualizing as opposed to the uncounted raw data.\n\n\n\nArranging Bars\nOne very common visualization need is to arrange the bars in ascending or descending order. We can do so by modifying the data first with forcats::fct_reorder().\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  count(color, name = \"count\") |&gt; # tzbulate by color variable \n  mutate(color = fct_reorder(.f = color, \n                             .x = count,\n                             .desc = TRUE)) |&gt; # reorder color variable based on the count \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, \n                       y = count)) + # create plot\n  geom_col(fill = \"cornflowerblue\") # visualize bar chart layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Categories\nWe sometimes want to visualize multiple categories on the same graph. For example, in the diamonds dataset, we might want to examine the frequencies of cut by color for only Ideal or Premium cuts.\n\nStacked Bar Chart\nWe can do this by adding a fill aesthetic to the graph. We also need to do some data manipulation first to create a count by cut and color. To arrange the graph such that the graph is still descending by color, we also need to add a count by color, which we can do with the group_by() and mutate() functions.\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  filter(cut %in% c(\"Ideal\", \n                    \"Premium\")) |&gt; # keep only rows where cut is Ideal or Premium\n  count(color, cut, name = \"count\") |&gt; # tabulate by color and cut, counting by each unique combination\n  group_by(color) |&gt; # group by color\n  mutate(color_count = sum(count)) |&gt; # aggregate by color, but adding a variable so observation level stays the same\n  ungroup() |&gt; # remove grouping\n  mutate(color = fct_reorder(.f = color, \n                             .x = color_count, \n                             .desc = TRUE)) |&gt; # reorder color to be descending based on count of color \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, \n                       y = count, \n                       fill = cut)) + # create graph\n  geom_col() # plot layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStacked Bar Chart, Standardized Vertically\nIf we wanted a stacked bar chart that represents the proportion of a category made up by another category, we could do this with the position aesthetic.\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  filter(cut %in% c(\"Ideal\", \n                    \"Premium\")) |&gt; # keep only rows where cut is Ideal or Premium\n  count(color, cut, name = \"count\") |&gt; # tabulate by color and cut, counting by each unique combination\n  group_by(color) |&gt; # group by color\n  mutate(color_count = sum(count)) |&gt; # aggregate by color, but adding a variable so observation level stays the same\n  ungroup() |&gt; # remove grouping\n  mutate(color = fct_reorder(.f = color, \n                             .x = color_count, \n                             .desc = TRUE)) |&gt; # reorder color to be descending based on count of color \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, \n                       y = count, \n                       fill = cut)) + # create graph\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\") # plot layer such that there are standardized bars\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will discuss later how to change the scales to be percent.\n\n\n\nDodged Bar Chart\nLet’s say instead we wanted to visualize the genders present in the data frame with colors side by side. We can do this by setting the position aesthetic equal to \"dodge\".\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  filter(cut %in% c(\"Ideal\", \n                    \"Premium\")) |&gt; # keep only rows where cut is Ideal or Premium\n  count(color, cut, name = \"count\") |&gt; # tabulate by color and cut, counting by each unique combination\n  group_by(color) |&gt; # group by color\n  mutate(color_count = sum(count)) |&gt; # aggregate by color, but adding a variable so observation level stays the same\n  ungroup() |&gt; # remove grouping\n  mutate(color = fct_reorder(.f = color, \n                             .x = color_count, \n                             .desc = TRUE)) |&gt; # reorder color to be descending based on count of color \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, \n                       y = count, \n                       fill = cut)) + # create graph\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") # change position such that it is a chart with side by side columns\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we wanted to reorder the bars such that Ideal goes first, we could use the forcats::fct_rev() function, which reverses the levels in a factor.\n\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  filter(cut %in% c(\"Ideal\", \n                    \"Premium\")) |&gt; # keep only rows where cut is Ideal or Premium\n  count(color, cut, name = \"count\") |&gt; # tabulate by color and cut, counting by each unique combination\n  group_by(color) |&gt; # group by color\n  mutate(color_count = sum(count)) |&gt; # aggregate by color, but adding a variable so observation level stays the same\n  ungroup() |&gt; # remove grouping\n  mutate(color = fct_reorder(.f = color, \n                             .x = color_count, \n                             .desc = TRUE)) |&gt; # reorder color to be descending based on count of color \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, \n                       y = count, \n                       fill = fct_rev(cut))) + # create graph with factor reversed\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") # change position such that it is a chart with side by side columns"

The data works best with the ggplot2 package if it is in the tidy format.\nThe first step of creating a plot is the ggplot() function. We often use the data as the first argument in this function.\n\n\nggplot(data = diamonds)\n\n\n\n\n\nBy itself, the function only produces a blank plot.\n\n\nAesthetic Mappings\nEach ggplot plot should have a set of aesthetic mappings that map variables in the data to visual properties, By mapping do not think land map - mapping refers to aligning data to visual properties in graphs.\nFor example, we might want to map our x axis to carat and our y axis to price from the diamonds data frame.\n\nggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Note that the plot still does not include observation-level data, but the x and y axes are defined.

    "text": "Additional Features\n\nScales\nScales are responsible for updating the limits of a plot, setting the breaks, formatting the labels, and possibly applying a transformation.\nTo use scales, one can use one of the scale functions that are patterned as scale_&lt;aesthetic&gt;_type() functions where &lt;aesthetic&gt; is one of the pairings mde in the mapping part of a plot. For example, to change the y-axis of the graph, we might use the scale_y_continuous() function.\n\nggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + \n  geom_point() + #add point layer\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), # set y axis limits\n                     breaks = seq(0, 20000, 2000), # set tic marks\n                     labels = scales::dollar  # change the format of the labels to show $\n                     ) + \n  scale_color_hue()  # add color theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacets\nFacets can creat multiple plots based on categories or subsets of data. We can quickly split data up to look at relationships within a category or other kinds of patterns.\nFacets must be given as a formula, designated by the ~ operator in R.\nLet’s plot the same plot from before except using a facet instead of examining cut by color.\n\n\nggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + \n  geom_point() + #add point layer\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), # set y axis limits\n                     breaks = seq(0, 20000, 2000), # set tic marks\n                     labels = scales::dollar  # change the format of the labels to show $\n                     )  + \n  facet_wrap(~cut) # add facet by the cut category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordiantes\nCoordinates are how the plot interprets position aesthetics. Typically Cartesian coordinates are used, which is what we use for our standard graphs. However, there are other coordinate systems, which we will discuss in more detail next lesson when we start creating geographic maps.\nWe can use coordinates to flip our x and y axes for the graph. The coord_flip() function flips Cartesian coordinates so that horizontal becomes vertical and vertical, horizontal.\nI like this especially for bar charts.\n\n\nggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), # set y axis limits\n                     breaks = seq(0, 20000, 2000), # set tic marks\n                     labels = scales::dollar  # change the format of the labels to show $\n                     )  + \n  coord_flip()\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\nThemes control aspects about visuals for the plot that do not have to do with the data. We can use the themes for a variety of attributes, including location of legends, backbground color for the plot, axes attributes, etc.\nWe modify theme attributes with the theme() function.\n\n\nggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), # set y axis limits\n                     breaks = seq(0, 20000, 2000), # set tic marks\n                     labels = scales::dollar  # change the format of the labels to show $\n                     )  + \n  coord_flip() + \n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"), # change background color to white \n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # remove grid lines\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) # remove grid lines\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also a number of theme_*() functions that essentially have modified many of these options about these attributes already and bundled them into one function.\n\n\nggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), # set y axis limits\n                     breaks = seq(0, 20000, 2000), # set tic marks\n                     labels = scales::dollar  # change the format of the labels to show $\n                     )  + \n  coord_flip() + # flip the x and y axis\n  theme_minimal() # use a minimal theme\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI am in the process of developing an fhfatheme package for creating visuals with consistent theming across FHFA products created in R.

The default method combines its arguments to form a vector. All arguments are coerced to a common type which is the type of the returned value, and all attributes except names removed.\nmean() : Generic function for the (trimmed) arithmetic mean.\nsort() : Sort (or order) a vector or factor into ascending or descending order.\n&lt;from&gt;:&lt;to&gt; : Generate regular sequences.\nseq() : Generate regular sequences (with more options than :).\npaste() : Concatenate vectors after converting to character.\nnchar() : Takes a character vector as an argument and returns a vector whose elements contain the sizes of the corresponding elements of x.\nlength() : Get or set the length of vectors (including lists) and factors, and of any other R object for which a method has been defined.\n[] : Operator that acts on vectors, matrices, arrays, and lists to extract or replace parts.\nNA : NA is a logical constant of length ` which contains a missing value indicator.\nis.na() : Indicates which elements of a vector are missing. Returns TRUE if missing, otherwise FALSE.\ntypeof() : Determined the (R internal) type or storage mode of any object.\nis.numeric() : Determines if a vector is of a class numeric or not.\nis.logical() : Determines if a vector is of type logical or not.\nis.character() : Determines if a vector is of type character or not.\nas.numeric() : Converts vector to numeric.\nas.logical() : Converts vector to logical.\nas.character() : Converts vector to character.\n\n\nArithmetic Operators\nYou can use arithmetic operators with numeric vectors as well as with single elements.\nHere is a list of arithmetic operators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nName\nExample\n\n\n\n\n+\nAddition\nx + y\n\n\n-\nSubtraction\nx - y\n\n\n*\nMultiplication\nx * y\n\n\n/\nDivision\nx / y\n\n\n^\nExponent\nx ^ y\n\n\n%%\nModulus (Remainder from division)\nx %% y\n\n\n&&\nInteger Division\nx&&y\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: W3Schools\n\n\nComparison Operators\nComparison operators are used to compare two values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nName\nExample\n\n\n\n\n==\nEqual\nx == y\n\n\n!=\nNot equal\nx != y\n\n\n&gt;\nGreater than\nx &gt; y\n\n\n&lt;\nLess than\nx &lt; y\n\n\n&gt;=\nGreater than or equal to\nx &gt;= y\n\n\n&lt;=\nLess than or equal to\nx &lt;= y\n\n\n%in%\nHave values within\nx %in% y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical Operators\nLogical operators are used to combine conditional statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nName\nExample\n\n\n\n\n&\nAND operator.

R posseses a simple generic function mechanism which can be used for an object-oriented style of programming.\n\n\n\n\ndplyr Basics\n\n\ndplyr::glimpse() : Prints information about a data frame or tibble to the console.\ndplyr::mutate() : Creates new columns that are functions of existing variables. It can also modify (if the name is the same as an existing column) and delete columns (by setting their value to NULL).\ndplyr::filter() : Used to subset a data frame, retaining all rows that satisfy your conidtions. To be retained, the row must produce a value of TRUE for all conditions. Note that when a condition evaluates to NA the row will be dropped, unlike base subsetting with [.\ndplyr::select() : Select (and optionally rename) variables in a data frame, using a concise mini-language that makes it easy to refer to varaibles based on their name (e.g. &lt;a&gt;:&lt;f&gt; selects all columns from a on the left to f on the right) or type (e.g. where(is.numeric) selects all numeric columns).\ntidyselect::everything() : Selects all variables. It is also useful in ocmbination with other tidyselect operators.\ndplyr::arrange() : Orders the rows of a dta frame by the values of selected columns.\ndplyr::count() : Lets you quickly count the unique values of one or more variables.\ndplyr::group_by() : Most data operations are done on groups defined by variables. group_by() takes an existing tbl and converts it into a grouped tbl where operations are performed “by group”.\ndplyr::ungroup() : Removes grouping.\ndplyr::summarise() : Returns on row for each combination of grouping variables; if there are no grouping variables, the output will have a single row summarasing all ovservations in the input. It will contain one column for each grouping variable and one column for each of the summary statistics that you have specified. summarise() and summarize() are synonyms.\n\n\n\nThe pipe operator: |&gt;\n\n|&gt; : Passes, or pipes, the result of the left-hand side expression to the right-hand side expression. If the right-hand side expression is a function call, then the left-hand-side is inserted as the first argument in the call."

    "text": "Augmented Vectors\nAtomic vectors are the building blocks for other important vector types like factors and dates. These augmented vectors have a class, so they behave differently than the atomic vector on which they are built.\n\nFactors\nFactors are designed to represent categorical data. They take a fixed set of possible values that can be ordered or unordered.\nThey are built on top of integer (not character).\nHere’s an example from Hadley Wickam’s R for Data Science.\n\n\n# create factor\nx &lt;- factor(c(\"ab\", \"cd\", \"ab\"), levels = c(\"ab\", \"cd\", \"ef\"))\n\n# get type of variable\ntypeof(x)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n# get attributes of variable \nattributes(x)\n\n$levels\n[1] \"ab\" \"cd\" \"ef\"\n\n$class\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\n The levels attribute identifies the unique values the factor can have. We see that the class is of type factor.\nFactors are important when we want to limit categorical variables to having only certin values, or when we want to arrnage a variable by a particular set of levels.\nTo take another example from Mr. Wickham: \n\n# set unique month levels in order\nmonth_levels &lt;- c(\"Jan\", \n                  \"Feb\", \n                  \"Mar\", \n                  \"Apr\", \n                  \"May\", \n                  \"Jun\", \n                  \"Jul\", \n                  \"Aug\", \n                  \"Sep\", \n                  \"Oct\", \n                  \"Nov\", \n                  \"Dec\")\n\n# create character vector\nx1 &lt;- c(\"Dec\", \"Apr\", \"Jan\", \"Mar\")\n\n# convert character vector to factor\ny1 &lt;- factor(x1, levels = month_levels)\n\n# print factor\ny1\n\n[1] Dec Apr Jan Mar\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n# print sorted factor \nsort(y1)\n\n[1] Jan Mar Apr Dec\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\n Any values not in the set will be converted to NA. \n\n# create factor with noncorming input\nfactor(c(\"Jan\", \"Not Jan\"), \n       levels = month_levels)\n\n[1] Jan  &lt;NA&gt;\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\n Factors will be especially helpful in data visualization, which we will be doing later in this course. \n\n\nDates\nDates are another common extension of an atomic vector. Dates are built upon numeric vectors. \n\nbefore &lt;- as.Date(\"1969-01-01\")\n\ntypeof(before)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\nattributes(before)\n\n$class\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\n\n\nlubridate package\nThe lubridate package has a bunch of functions to more easily work with Dates in R.\nThe ymd(), ydm(), mdy(), myd(), dmy(), and dym() functions all flexibly take in a wide variety of input formats bsed on the function, where y means year, m means month, and d means day. \n\nmdy(\"April 10th, 2024\")\n\n[1] \"2024-04-10\"\n\nmdy(\"Wednesday, 04-10-2024\")\n\n[1] \"2024-04-10\"\n\nymd(\"2024/04/10\")\n\n[1] \"2024-04-10\"\n\n\n Once a vector has been converted to a date object, we can then use functions like:\n\nyear(): extract year from date\nmonth(): extract month from date\nday(): extract day from date\nwday(): extract weekday from date\nquarter(): extract quarter from date\n\nto extract what we need from a date."

    "section": "Reading in data",
    "text": "Reading in data\nIn general, many of the functions used to read in data in R will have the read prefix.\n\nread::read_csv(): read in .csv files\nreadxl::read_excel(): read in .xlsx or .xls files\nhaven::read_sas() read in .sas7bdat or .sas7bcat files\nhaven::read_stata(): read in .dta files\nreadRDS(): read in native .RDS files\narrow::read_feather(): read in .feather files\narrow::read_parquet(): read in .parquet files\n\nThe data.table::fread() function is also available for readin gin large .csv files relatively fast.\n\n\nR paths\nThere are a few things you should know about paths in R.\n\nWith R paths, you must use / slashes to indicate folders within a path, not \\.\nYou can reference up a directory using relative file paths with ../.\nYou can change your current directory with the setwd(\"&lt;path&gt;\") function. I recommend not to do this, as it makes it more difficult to collaborate with others. Use getwd() to see your current directory (or look at the top of the console).\nEach of the read_* functions has arguments that can help read in the data. For example, some allow you to skip rows when reading in, only read in certain columns, set column types, and more.\n\n\n\n\nReading .csv files\nFor the simplest use cases, the various read functions will need just one argument: the path to the file you want to load.\n\n\nsepal &lt;- read_csv(\"data/iris.csv\")\n\n \nI encourage the use of relative filepaths like this, but you could use the aboslute file path if you would like as well.\n\n\nsepal &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/christopherdavis/intro-to-r/lesson_code/02_lesson/data/iris.csv\")\n\n\nWe can now work with this data frame as we would any other.\n\n\nsepal |&gt; \n  filter(Species == \"setosa\")\n\n\n\nReading large .csv files\nOne function that may help speed up reading in large .csv files is the data.table::fread() function. It uses C++ under the hood to optimize reading in the data.\n\n\nsas_dat &lt;- read_sas(\"Data/UADAggs_nat_V3_0.sas7bdat\")\nstata_dat &lt;- read_stata(\"data/UADAggs_nat_V3_0.dta\")\n\n\nYou can also read in xpt SAS transfer files.\n\n\nxpt_dat &lt;- read_xpt(\"data/UADAggs_nat_V3_0.xpt\")\n\n\n\n\n\nReading Excel Files\nReading in Excel files is a little more complicated because there are sometimes more than one sheet to work with.\nTo find out the excel sheets in a particular excel file, use the readxl::excel_sheets() function.\n\n\nexcel_path &lt;- \"data/cars.xlsx\"\n\nmy_sheets &lt;- excel_sheets(excel_path)\n\nmy_sheets\n\n\nWe can then read in the data based on the excel sheet.\n\n\nread_excel(excel_path, \n           sheet = my_sheets[1])\n\n\nread_excel(excel_path, \n           sheet = my_sheets[2])\n\n\n\n\nNative .RDS files\nWe can read in native .RDS files with the readRDS() function.\n\n\nreadRDS(\"data/UADAggs_nat_V3_0.RDS\")\n\n\n.RDS files are files specific to R and are relatively small.\n\n\n\nArrow: .feather and .parquet\nFeather and Parquet formats are designed to be faster and more streamlined than other data formats, especially for big data (large data frames). Some estimates find them to take up at least 87 percent less space and be 34 times faster to read in as compared to .csv files. For reference, even .csv files are much faster to read into R than .sas7bdat files.\nTehse files achieve this with binary storge in columnar format as opposed to a row-based format. Each column holds values for a single attribute across all rows.\n\n\nSource:Medium\n\nHere’s the code to read in these files.\n\n\nread_feather(\"data/UADAggs_nat_V3_0.feather\")\nread_parquet(\"data/UADAggs_nat_V3_0.parquet\")\n\n\n\nFeather vs. Parquet\n\nBoth options are very fast, but Feather is faster.\nParquet is better for long-term storage and is smaller\nFeather is much larger as it isn’t natively compressed (it is still 6 times smaller than its .sas7bdat equivalent). It is also likely to change its features more often, so is less stable. It is more suitable for short-term storage or intermediary datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOne of the only drawbacks of using these files is that because they are in binary format, the raw data version of these files cannot be easily read by humans. That’s okay, though, we can just read them in!"
