    "text": "Introduction to R\nWelcome to the Introduction to R class! {width = “50”}\nNote that this site is an abridged version of the full 6 course class taught at a government agency. It has been modified for public display.\nThe repository is laid out as follows:\n\n/exercises/: the R script (.R) and Quarto (.qmd) exercises that we will be working with throughout the course\n/lesson_code/: the Quarto (.qmd) documents that are used to generate the html documents\n/_site/: the html documents of the tutorials. Open up the index.html file to view the website and corresponding materials.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nNo prior R experience is assumed to take this course. Before attending, please remember to ensure that R and R Studio have been downloaded.\nConsider changing some options in RStudio before the class. Under the Tools -&gt; Global Options menu items, you can customize multiple options to your preferences.\nI recommend to:\n\nIn General\nUncheck Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup\n\nAssign Never to Save workspace to .Rdata on exit\n\nIn Appearance\n\nPlay around with the Editor theme and decide on what you like\n\nIn R Markdown\n\nShow output preview in View Pane\nUncheck Show output inline for RMarkdown documents\n\n\n\n\nWhat is R?\nR is a free, open source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is known for robust visualization capabilities and a growing library of statistical and analytic methods.\nR has an exensive user base that benefit from the libraries that others have created through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). CRAN is a network of FTP and web servers that store versions of code and documentation for R.\nR is maintained by the R Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the continued development of R for satistical and computational research.\n\n\nWhat is RStudio?\nRStudio is a free integrated development entironment (IDE) for R, created by the private organization Posit (formally RStudio). An IDE is a graphical user interface that consolidates different features helpful for writing code into one application. Other examples of IDEs include SAS Enterprise Guide, VSCode, Jupyter, or Spyder.\nWhich IDE you might choose might depend on the programming language and personal preference. However, I recommend using RStudio forR - it has the most built out features for programming in R.\n\n\nWhy R?\n\nOpen Source: R is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified by anyone.\nPopular: R is one of the most popular statistical tools for data analysis. Given its growing popularity over paid softwares like SAS or Stata, future employees will likely know R or have some experience with it.\nExcellent visualization tools: R excels at data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and reproduciability, but it is probably best known for its graphics. R visualizations are the gold standard for reproducible data visualizations.\nFlexibility: Given its open source nature, R makes it easy to build off of work that others have already done. Over the past three decades, users have been contributing to the R ecosystem, which has allowed for the expansion of libraries and functions to do nearly any kind of data analysis task. If you have a data analysis need, it is likely that someone else has had a similar need and written code already to complete it.\nReproducible: Like most programming languages, R is fully reproducible and encourages workflows to be entirely reproducible. This means that you are able to run through the entire workflow, start to finish, and achieve the same results.\n\n\n\nOther Resources\n\nR for Data Science by Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This books is the gold standard for R programming. Co-written by the creator of tidyverse and ggplot2, this free book goes over the core concept of tidy data and how to work with tidy data in R.\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham. This book provides a more theoretical and comprehensive understanding of the decisions underlying the construction of ggplot2.\nText Mining with R: A Tidy Approach by Julia Silge and David Robinson. This book provides a comprehensive overview of text mining in R.\nGeocomputation with R by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and James Muenchow. This book provides tutorials for how to do various spatial operations in R, including analyzing and modeling geographic data, mapping (both static and interactive), and statistical operations.\nHands-On Machine Learning with R by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell. This book provides an overview of machine learning in R.\nCheat Sheets by Posit (formally RStudio). These cheat sheets are a great resource to provide an overview of relevant functions in many commonly-used packages.\nHarvardX: Data Science: Visualization. This is an online course that goes over basic data visualization principles and how to apply them using ggplot2."

    "text": "Atomic Vectors\nAll elements within an atomic vector must have the same type. You can create a vector with the c() function with elements separated by ,.\nThere are four primary commonly-used atomic vectors.\n\n\n\nSource: Advanced R by Wickham\n\n\n\n\nnumeric Vectors: integer and double\nLike the name denotes, integer vectors all must be whole numbers. double vectors can have any number of decimals.\nMost functions we’ll use treat integer vectors and double vectors similarly. For example:\n\n\n# *digit*L is the way to identify integers in R\ninteger_vector &lt;- c(2L, \n                    4L, \n                    1L, \n                    3L)\n\nmean(integer_vector)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\n\ngives the same result as:\n\n\n# can reference double with just the digits\ndouble_vector &lt;- c(2, \n                   4, \n                   1, \n                   3)\n\nmean(double_vector)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\n\nFor our purposes, we will think of both of these types of vectors as numeric and treat them similarly.\n\n\nSorting vectors\nYou can sort any vector with the sort() function.\n\nsort(double_vector)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n\nnumeric vectors in a sequence\nTo create a numeric vector with sequential numbers, use the syntax &lt;from&gt;:&lt;to&gt;.\n\n\n# create a sequential numeric vector from 1 to 5\nsequential &lt;- 1:5\n\nsequential\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\nIf you want to increment by smoething else, use the seq() function.\nThis function takes int he following arguments:\n\n\nfrom: starting value\n\nto: ending value\n\nby: increment of the sequence\n\n\n\n# create sequence, increment by 3\n\nby_3 &lt;- seq(from = 1, \n            to = 25, \n            by = 3)\n\nby_3\n\n[1]  1  4  7 10 13 16 19 22 25\n\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic operators\nYou can use arthmetic operators with numeric vectors as well as with single elements.\nHere is a list of arithmetic operators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nName\nExample\n\n\n\n\n+\nAddition\nx + y\n\n\n-\nSubtraction\nx - y\n\n\n*\nMultiplication\nx * y\n\n\n/\nDivision\nx / y\n\n\n^\nExponent\nx ^ y\n\n\n%%\nModulus (Remainder from division)\nx %% y\n\n\n&&\nInteger Division\nx&&y\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: W3Schools\n\nThese operators are vectorized, which means the operation will occur for each element of the vector.\nFor example, remember the sequential vector:\n\n\n# sequence, incremented by 1\nsequential\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\nWe can create a new vector with an arithmetic operator:\n\n\n# add 1\n\nsequential_plus_1 &lt;- sequential + 1\n\nsequential_plus_1\n\n[1] 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\n\nEach element of the vector was changed.\nWe can also use vectors of the same length on either side of the arithmetic opertor:\n\n\ncharacter_vector &lt;- c(\"This\", \n                      \"is\", \n                      \"a\",\n                      \"string\")\n\ncharacter_vector\n\n[1] \"This\"   \"is\"     \"a\"      \"string\"\n\n\n You can concatenate strings in base R with the paste() function. \n\n# initialize strings\n\nstring_1 &lt;- \"This is\"\nstring_2 &lt;- \"a string\"\n\n# use paste function with multiple strings\npaste(string_1, \n      string_2, \n      sep = \" \") # use sep argument to add separater between strings\n\n[1] \"This is a string\"\n\n\n You can concatenate strings in the same vector with the collapse argument. \n\n# concatenate strings in the same vector \npaste(character_vector, collapse = \" \")\n\n[1] \"This is a string\"\n\n\n You can count the number of characters in each element of a character vector with the nchar() function. \n\n# get length of each element\nnum_chars &lt;- nchar(character_vector)\n\nnum_chars\n\n[1] 4 2 1 6\n\n\n To get the total number of elements of any vector, you can use the length() function. \n\n# get length of vector\nlength_num &lt;- length(num_chars)\n\nlength_num\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogical Vectors\nLogical vectors are limited to binary TRUE and FALSE values.\n\n\n# this is a logical vector\n\nlogical_vector &lt;- c(TRUE, \n                    TRUE, \n                    FALSE, \n                    TRUE)\n\nlogical_vector\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\n\nLogical vectors are extremely useful in R, as they can be used to flag and subset values.\n\n\nComparison Operators\nComparison opertors are used to compare two values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nName\nExample\n\n\n\n\n==\nEqual\nx == y\n\n\n!=\nNot equal\nx != y\n\n\n&gt;\nGreater than\nx &gt; y\n\n\n&lt;\nLess than\nx &lt; y\n\n\n&gt;=\nGreater than or equal to\nx &gt;= y\n\n\n&lt;=\nLess than or equal to\nx &lt;= y\n\n\n%in%\nHave values within\nx %in% y\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use a comprison of two values, one on each side, and it will provide 1 logical result.\n\n\n# what values in sequential are equal to 4? \n\nsequential == 4\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\nOr, you can have vectors on both sides.\n\n\n# my name with old middle initial before marriage \nold_me &lt;- c(\"Christopher\", \n            \"W\", \n            \"Davis\")\n\n# my name with new middle initial after marriage\n\nnew_me &lt;- c(\"Christopher\", \n            \"P\", \n            \"Davis\")\n\n# test what elements are the same \nold_me == new_me\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\n For this to work correctly, both sides of the comparison must have an equal length().\nOther operations work as you might expect.\n\n\n# test less than operator\n\nvalues &lt;- c(1, \n            3, \n            2, \n            5, \n            2)\n\nvalues &lt; 3\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\n\n\n# test greater than or equal to operator \n\nvalues &gt;= 4\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\n\nThe %in% operator\nThe %in% opertor returns TRUE for each element on the left hand side tht is within an element on the right hand side.

They allow for fast collaboration with others on code, as all files are referenced through relative file paths relative to the project directory. Others will be able to quickly reproduce your work.\nI recommend to always use R projects whenever working in R. Using relative file paths (relative to the project directory) such as data/raw_data.csv instead of absolute filepaths like C:/Users/davischr/proj/intro-to-r/data/raw_data.csv can help share code ina more collaborative way - others don’t have to change your code to run it.

If we want to limit observations based off of information in the dataset, we can use the filter() function.\nWe use a logical vector that we can either create in the filter() function call or access already in the dataset (if it exists as a variable already).\nFor example, let’s keep only observations where the height is less than 100 cm.\n\n\n# create logical vector in filter() function call \n\nfilter(.data = starwars, \n       height &lt; 100)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 14\n  name      height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 R2-D2         96    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, bl… red               33 none  mascu…\n2 R5-D4         97    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, red red               NA none  mascu…\n3 Yoda          66    17 white      green      brown            896 male  mascu…\n4 Wicket S…     88    20 brown      brown      brown              8 male  mascu…\n5 Ratts Ty…     79    15 none       grey, blue unknown           NA male  mascu…\n6 Dud Bolt      94    45 none       blue, grey yellow            NA male  mascu…\n7 R4-P17        96    NA none       silver, r… red, blue         NA none  femin…\n# ℹ 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;,\n#   vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;\n\n\n\nThere is no logical vector in the starwars data frame yet, but we’ll create one soon.\nYou can use logical operators, | (or) and “&” (and), as well.\n\n\n# filter observations with height &lt; 100 OR species equal to \"Droid\" \n\nfilter(.data = starwars, \n       height &lt; 100 | species == \"Droid\")\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 14\n   name     height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex   gender\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 C-3PO       167    75 &lt;NA&gt;       gold       yellow           112 none  mascu…\n 2 R2-D2        96    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, bl… red               33 none  mascu…\n 3 R5-D4        97    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, red red               NA none  mascu…\n 4 Yoda         66    17 white      green      brown            896 male  mascu…\n 5 IG-88       200   140 none       metal      red               15 none  mascu…\n 6 Wicket …     88    20 brown      brown      brown              8 male  mascu…\n 7 Ratts T…     79    15 none       grey, blue unknown           NA male  mascu…\n 8 Dud Bolt     94    45 none       blue, grey yellow            NA male  mascu…\n 9 R4-P17       96    NA none       silver, r… red, blue         NA none  femin…\n10 BB8          NA    NA none       none       black             NA none  mascu…\n# ℹ 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;,\n#   vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;\n\n\n\n\n# filter observations with height &lt; 100 AND species equal to \"Droid\" \n\nfilter(.data = starwars, \n       height &lt; 100 & species == \"Droid\")\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 14\n  name   height  mass hair_color skin_color  eye_color birth_year sex   gender  \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 R2-D2      96    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, blue red               33 none  masculi…\n2 R5-D4      97    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, red  red               NA none  masculi…\n3 R4-P17     96    NA none       silver, red red, blue         NA none  feminine\n# ℹ 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;,\n#   vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;\n\n\n\nYou can do the same thing, which is include multiple conditions that all must be TRUE for observations to be retained, by separating conditions with a comma.\n\n\n# filter observations with height &lt; 100 AND species equal to \"Droid\"\n\nfilter(.data = starwars,\n       height &lt; 100, \n       species == \"Droid\")\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 14\n  name   height  mass hair_color skin_color  eye_color birth_year sex   gender  \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 R2-D2      96    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, blue red               33 none  masculi…\n2 R5-D4      97    32 &lt;NA&gt;       white, red  red               NA none  masculi…\n3 R4-P17     96    NA none       silver, red red, blue         NA none  feminine\n# ℹ 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;,\n#   vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;"

This does two things:\n\n\nCreates an object. You can think of an object like you would in real life, but in the virtual world (basically any kind of noun).\nCreates a name that points to that object.\n\n\nThis allows you to reference the object that the object name points to without needing to type in the values again.\n\n\n#assign values to an object reference\nvar &lt;- 3 + 4\n\nvar\n\n[1] 7\n\n\n\nThe &lt;- operator is used as opposed to most programming languages where the default assignment is =. In R, = does work for assignment, but it is best practice to use &lt;-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you type th eobject name without assignment, it wil print the result automatically.\n\n\n\n\nValid Names\nObject name must consist of letters, digits, and _. They cannot begin with a _ or a digit.\nR will not let hyou use names that are reserved, like if or function. It is also bad practice to overwrite base functions or other functions that you would like to use (like mean())."
